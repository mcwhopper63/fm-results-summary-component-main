## My process

Started out with the main card that houses a right card, and a left card.

The left card will hold the score information.
- I've used three containers here

The right card will hold the summary of the score.
- I've used five unlisted list items
- I've used a button at the bottom

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've applied role attributes to the important divs. 

I've used DRY methods for my css. 

I'm getting better at parent - child relationships, and how containers should be configured so the children elements find their positions nicely.
